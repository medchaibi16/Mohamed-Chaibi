## About Me

I am a creative and independent computer science student who enjoys thinking outside the box and designing systems that solve real problems efficiently.

Rather than following predefined paths, I prefer understanding *why* systems work, identifying weaknesses, and building better approaches — such as automating repetitive processes or optimizing decision-making pipelines.

I do not memorize syntax by heart; instead, I focus on understanding logic, architecture, and error patterns, which allows me to adapt quickly to new technologies.

## What I’m Looking For

I am seeking a **remote research or software engineering internship**, particularly in areas related to:

- AI systems that understand or model **human emotions**
- Human-centered or affective computing
- Intelligent automation with real-world impact
- Research-driven or experimental engineering projects

I am open to **both paid and unpaid** opportunities, with a strong preference for environments that value learning, respect, and meaningful collaboration.
